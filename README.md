# Gravity Forms Not Live Chat

Live chat is lovely isn't it? Until you have to staff it and be all responsive to potential customers. This plugin allows WordPress websites to look like they offer live chat, but in fact it is just a contact form. On mobile, it becomes a click-to-call button. Think Intercom but without being anything like Intercom.

> This WordPress plugin requires Gravity Forms.

## Installation

1. Download the zip file and install
2. Adjust settings for the Not Live Chat plugin in Gravity Forms -> Not Live Chat.
3. Import the sample form, if required. `gravityforms-sample-form.json` can be found within the plugin's main directory.

If you want to change styling of the popup, you can either use the Customizer and target the `.tend_nlc_chat` class, or use the `tend_nlc.scss` file within the plugin.

* Please note the media query is hard-coded within `js/tend-nlc.js`.

## To do:
* Localization
* Media query a user-definable option
* Serialize options
