# 10Â° Not Live Chat

Live chat is lovely isn't it? Until you have to staff it and be all responsive to potential customers. This plugin allows WordPress websites to look like they offer live chat, but in fact it is just a contact form. On mobile, it becomes a click-to-call button. Think Intercom but without being anything like Intercom.

* Currently requires a Gravity Form.
* Media query is hard-coded.

Basically, you'll probably need to do a bit of work.

## To do:
* Localization.
* Media query an option
* Don't require Gravity Forms - replace with a shortcode perhaps
* Separate out admin and front-end code
* Proper plugin deactivation
