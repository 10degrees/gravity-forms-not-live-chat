# tend-not-live-chat
Looks like a live chat, smells like a live chat, is not live chat.

* Currently requires a Gravity Form.
* Media query is hard-coded.


Basically, you'll probably need to do a bit of work.

## To do:
* Requires localization.
* Make media query an option
* Don't require Gravity Forms - replace with a shortcode perhaps
* Seperate out admin and front-end code
